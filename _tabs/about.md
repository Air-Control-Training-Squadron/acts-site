## ACTS History

### Beginnings

Air Control Training Squadron (ACTS), a critical component of Marine Corps Communication-Electronics School (MCCES), has roots that date back to 1932, when MCCES began as the Pigeon and Flag Handler Platoon. By 1942, it was activated as the Signal School in Quantico, VA, and started offering courses in the communications field by 1943. The Signal School would eventually be renamed as Communication-Electronics School Battalion in 1953.

### Modern Day

The journey of ACTS began in earnest in 2013, when it was activated under MCCES. At the time, the former Company C was re-designated as Detachment Bravo and the former Company A as Detachment Alpha, both under ACTS' authority and reportable to the Commanding Officer of MCCES. ACTS played a vital role in operational communications, communication-electronics maintenance, and air control / anti-air warfare operations training.

ACTS witnessed significant expansion in 2011 when MCCES absorbed other educational bodies, including the Communication School, MCB, Quantico, Virginia, Marine Detachment Fort Gordon, Georgia, Low Altitude Air Defense School, Fort Bliss, Texas and Marine Corps Representative, Sheppard AFB, Texas. This growth not only bolstered MCCES' capabilities but also extended the responsibilities and training domains of ACTS.

By 2014, ACTS was part of a significant shift when the Communication School moved from Quantico, Virginia, to Twenty-nine Palms, California. This move coincided with a substantial reorganization within MCCES. As per Marine Corps Bulletin 5400, dated 18 December 2014, MCCES was restructured into a Command Element, a Headquarters Company, an Air Control Training Squadron (ACTS), and a Communication Training Battalion.

Today, ACTS plays an integral role in training personnel in the fields of operational communications, communication-electronics maintenance, and air control / anti-air warfare operations. With a diverse and extensive set of courses, ACTS equips Marines with the vital skills they need to succeed in a rapidly evolving digital battlefield. It remains a key pillar of the MCCES, which continues to train over 6,500 personnel annually and is recognized as the largest formal school in the Marine Corps.

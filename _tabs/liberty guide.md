It is not intended to replace the official squadron order or to serve as a legal document. Its purpose is to help Marines understand some of the key points in a simplified and condensed format. It does not cover all the rules, regulations, procedures, and protocols specified in the full squadron order. As such, it may not fully detail your responsibilities or the penalties for non-compliance. For complete details, always refer to the original squadron order and official documents. Marines are responsible for fully understanding and complying with all aspects of the official squadron order. Any misunderstandings or misinterpretations from this quick reference guide are not an excuse for violating the policy.

## Liberty phases

All changes in liberty phases, either upgrades or reductions, are routed through company leadership to the Commanding Officer. Upgrades or reductions in liberty phase assignments are subject to the requirements outlined in the squadron order.

### Phase I
* Duration: First 45 days after arrival at the Marine Corps Communication-Electronics School (MCCES).
* Restrictions: Only on-base liberty is permitted. After liberty ends, Marines must stay in their assigned rooms until liberty starts again at 0500 the next day.
* Attire: All Phase I Marines who receive special liberty will wear the seasonal service uniform.

### Phase II
* Eligibility: Starts on the 46th day after arrival at MCCES.
* Privileges: Off-base liberty is allowed, but overnight liberty is not. Similar to Phase I, after liberty ends, Marines must stay in their assigned rooms until liberty restarts at 0500 the next day.

### Phase III
* Eligibility: Starts on the 60th day after arrival at MCCES, provided that the Marine is in good academic standing and not at risk of failing their current course. E-4 and above grade ELT Marines are automatically assigned to Phase III, unless rescinded due to academic risk. Marines who have completed their terminal course are also automatically assigned to Phase III.
* Privileges: Off-base and overnight liberty on Friday, Saturday, and during holiday periods (excluding the final night of the liberty period). Overnight liberty ends at 2200 on Sunday or the final night of the holiday period.

## Liberty limits

Liberty limits are measured from the front gates of MCAGCC. Any proposed exception to these limits will require a special liberty request. Liberty limits change based on the length of the liberty.

| **Workday**  | 30 miles  |
| **48 hours** | 100 miles |
| **72 hours** | 350 miles |
| **96 hours** | 500 miles |

## Liberty hours

Liberty will conclude at 2200 each night from Sunday to Thursday and restarts at 0500 the following morning. On Friday, Saturday, and during holiday periods, liberty ends at 2359 and recommences at 0500 the next day for Phase I and Phase II Marines.
Exceptions can be made for SMP trips, command liberty trips, MCCS activities, or events approved by a training officer.

## Liberty logbook and accountability

For on-base liberty, there is no need for a Marine to sign a logbook. Otherwise, to ensure accountability, all enlisted ELT Marines must sign out the liberty logbook located at the front desk of the barracks.
ELT Marines are to be accounted for by their designated student leader. This accountability should be reported to the Squadron Duty Officer (SDO) 15 minutes after liberty concludes daily. However, Phase III Marines with overnight liberty are exempt on Fridays, Saturdays, and holidays, as long as they've signed out in the off-base liberty logbook.

## Liberty buddy

All enlisted ELT Marines must have at least one liberty buddy and are forbidden from separating from them. If alcohol consumption is intended, the liberty buddy must also be over the age of 21. Liberty buddies may be military members, immediate family members, or spouses. For special functions such as SMP or MCCS trips, Marines may pair up with another attendee if they do not have a pre-planned liberty buddy.

## Privately owned vehicles (POVs)

ELT Marines can own and use Private Owned Vehicles (POVs). POVs must pass quarterly inspections and those pre-holiday, and any vehicles failing inspection can't be used until discrepancies are corrected and a re-inspection passed. Motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles are not permitted for ELT students either as primary transportation or for recreational use.

## Married ELT students

Married ELT Marines will be assigned to Phase II liberty once their spouse relocates to MCAGCC, have established a residence, and moved out of the barracks. These Marines are also eligible for Phase III liberty in accordance with this order.

## ELT student leave

Leave requests will be evaluated case-by-case for family emergencies, designated holiday leave blocks, or other extenuating circumstances. Requests for leave must be submitted through MOL with a completed HARP form. Marines waiting for training or between classes can participate in the Command Recruiting Program (CRP).

## Special liberty

Special liberty may be submitted as an exemption to any of the policies above, whether it may be leaving liberty bounds, driving alone, or requesting overnight liberty as a Phase II student. Special liberty requests will be submitted in MOL with a completed HARP form.
